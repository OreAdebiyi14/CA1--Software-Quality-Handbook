# Task Estimation in Scrum 

---

## **1. Overview & Importance**  
- Task estimation is a critical process in Scrum that allows teams to predict effort, allocate resources effectively, and ensure a balanced workload.
- Without proper estimation, teams may struggle with missed deadlines, overworked developers, and uncontrolled scope creep. Proper task estimation enables better sprint planning, leading to predictable and efficient development cycles.
- For example, as discussed in **[Stories and Task Estimation](https://www.reddit.com/r/scrum/comments/18bbr88/stories_and_task_estimation/)**, teams that implemented structured estimation techniques saw a reduction in last-minute changes and improved sprint predictability.  

---

## **2. Key Guidelines for Effective Estimation**

**Define Clear Estimation Criteria** 
- Teams should establish a shared understanding of effort levels for different tasks. Using consistent criteria helps standardize estimation across different team members.

**Encourage Team Collaboration**  
- Estimation should be a collaborative effort involving all team members. Diverse perspectives lead to more accurate estimations, reducing the risk of underestimation or overestimation.

**Review & Improve Estimates Continuously** 
- Compare previous estimates with actual completion times to improve future accuracy.

**Select the Right Estimation Method** 
- Choose estimation techniques that fit the complexity of the task.

## **3. Different Types of Estimation**



**Consensus-Based Estimation:**
  - **Planning Poker** – A collaborative estimation technique where team members assign story points based on discussion and consensus.
  
**Relative Sizing:**
  - **T-Shirt Sizing** – Categorises tasks into sizes like XS, S, M, L, XL for quick estimation.
  - **Affinity Estimation** – Groups tasks based on similarities in effort, allowing teams to estimate large backlogs efficiently.
  
**Work Breakdown Approach:**
  - **Breaking Down Large Tasks** – Dividing large user stories into smaller tasks improves accuracy and reduces ambiguity in estimation.

## **4. Strategies to Improve Estimation Accuracy**
- **Include Risk Factors** – Consider complexity, dependencies, and uncertainties in estimations.
- **Timebox Estimation Discussions** – Avoid overanalysing estimates to keep the process efficient.
- **Run Post-Sprint Reviews** – Discuss estimation accuracy after sprints to refine future estimates.

---

## **5. Common Mistakes & Bad Practices**  



**Over-Estimating to Be Safe** – Excessive padding can lead to inefficiencies, resulting in wasted time and resources. 

**Underestimating Task Complexity** – Failing to account for hidden complexities can lead to unfinished sprints, technical debt, and missed deadlines.

**Lack of Iterative Improvement** – Not refining estimation techniques results in persistent inaccuracies.

# Code Reviews

**Purpose:**
- To define what code reviews are.
- Why they're important for everyone.
- To give practical and functional guidelines for both reviewers and authors.

**Goal:**
- To improve code quality.
- To increase the knowledge on Code reviewers.
- Promote a more positive collaborative culture.

---

## 1. Overview & Benefits

**What are code reviews?**
- Code reviews is a process that examines any code changes that are made before merging into the main branch.
- It focus on improving the quality of the code, catching any problems early and sharing experience with your team.

**Key Benefits:**
- Enhanced Quality: This helps identify bugs, improve the codes readability and ensure consistency.
- Collaboration: Creates a mutual learning and shared code ownership.
- Issue detection: Allows the team to catch any defects before they send a product out for production for example.

    ```mermaid
    graph TD;
        A[Developer Submits Pull Request] -->|Automated Tests Run| B{Tests Pass?};
        B -- No --> C[Fix Issues and Resubmit];
        B -- Yes --> D[Peer Code Review];
        D -->|Review Passed?| E{Approved?};
        E -- No --> F[Provide Feedback & Request Changes];
        F --> A;
        E -- Yes --> G[Merge to Main Branch];
        G --> H[Deployment & Monitoring];
        
        subgraph Benefits of Code Reviews
            I[Improves Code Quality] 
            J[Encourages Collaboration]
            K[Detects Issues Early]
            L[Ensures Consistency]
            M[Knowledge Sharing]
        end

        G -->|Code is Merged| I & J & K & L & M;

---

## 2. Best Practices for Reviewers
*Aim: Provide a clear guideline for any team to ensure constructive and efficient reviews.*

**Delivery & Feedback:**
- Be respectful and focus on only the code not the person coding. 
- Make sure the questions being asked are precise and clarifying to read and understand.

**Guidelines:**
- Point out the exact area that are needed for improvement.
- Explain why they need to make the change.
- Give effective solutions and clean code.

**Reviewers Checklist:**
- Is the code clear and understandable?
- Are the tests comprehensible?
- Does the code follow the standard set?
- Are there any issues with security or performance?

---

## 3. Best Practices for Code Authors
*Aim: Equip authors with pratical steps to prepare their code for a steady review process.*

**Preparation**
- Reviewing own work for any issues before submitting.
- Reduce the size of large features into smaller pull requests.
- Add detailed descriptions and contexts about the pull request.

**Engagement**
- Be open to feedback and ask questions.
- Update any relevant documentation and tests as needed.

**Do's**
- Write a clear commit message.
- Update relevant documentation.

**Dont's**
- Submit huge changes that have no aim.

---

## 4. Tools and Automation  
*Aim: Leverage automation to streamline the code review process and focus human effort on high-level analysis.*

**Why Automate?**  
- Handle trivial issues like formatting, linting, and simple syntax errors automatically.

**Recommended Tools:**  
- **Linters and Formatters:** Ensure consistent code style.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Run tests and static analysis before manual review.

**Integration Tips:**  
- Set up pre-review automation to catch low-level issues.
- Focus human review on logic, design, and potential risks.


**CI/CD Pipeline Dashboard Example:**

*Caption:* CI/CD pipeline dashboard displaying build status and test results.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Mitigation Strategies  
*Aim: Identify challenges and provide actionable tips to overcome them.*

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**  
- **Overly Large Pull Requests:** Difficult to review thoroughly.  
- **Unconstructive Criticism:** Personal or vague comments that hinder progress.
- **Ignoring Automation:** Manually reviewing issues that tools can catch.

```mermaid

    subgraph "Pitfalls (Don'ts)"
      D1[Overly Large PRs]
      D2[Unconstructive Criticism]
      D3[Ignoring Automation]
    end
```

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
- Break changes into smaller, focused PRs.
- Use standardized checklists to maintain objectivity.
- Encourage a culture of respectful feedback and continuous learning.

```mermaid

    subgraph "Solutions (Do's)"
      S1[Break changes into smaller PRs]
      S2[Use standardized checklists]
      S3[Foster respectful feedback]
    end
```

## 6. Quick Reference Summary  
*Aim: Provide a concise, one-page summary for rapid recall.*

**Key Takeaways:**  
- **For Reviewers:** Use clear, respectful, and actionable feedback.  
- **For Authors:** Prepare well, keep changes small, and be open to suggestions.  
- **Automation is Key:** Utilize tools to handle routine checks.
  
**Visual Summary:**
