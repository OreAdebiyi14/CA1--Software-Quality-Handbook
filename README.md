# CA1--Software-Quality-Handbook

## Project Overview

Your team works at a fast-moving startup with 20 software engineers. So far, engineers have been working in their own way, which has caused **unpredictable progress** and **frequent production defects**.

To address this, your team has been tasked with creating a **Software Quality Handbook** — a set of clear best practices for how things should be done across the company. This will be a go-to reference for **existing and new engineers**.

---

## Handbook Topics

The handbook will cover the following key topics:

- **Task Estimation in Scrum**
- **Code Reviews**
- **One additional topic of your choice** (based on research)

---

## Handbook Content Guidelines

- Find **5 high-quality resources per topic** (e.g., blog posts, case studies, practitioner write-ups).
- Focus on **personal experiences** over academic theory.
- Each topic section should:
  - Start with a brief **introduction**.
  - Provide **summarized guidelines** (bullet points, do/don't lists, diagrams).
  - Highlight both **best practices** and **bad practices** to avoid.
  - Include **links to references** for further reading.
- Aim for **500–1000 words** per topic.
- Use **diagrams or visuals** to make complex points easier to understand.

> The goal is **not** to write an essay — it's to make information **easy to skim and apply**.

---

## Process & Workflow

- The handbook will be created as a **public GitHub repository** using **Markdown**.
- Follow **Trunk-Based Development** (as practiced in Lab Week 6):
  - Each task/topic = separate feature branch
  - Changes merged via **pull requests**
  - All team members must **commit code** and **review PRs**
- Add a **Project Plan** to the repo:
  - List of all tasks to complete the project
  - Task order
  - Who is responsible for each task
- Each topic must have contributions from **at least 2 team members**

---

## Retrospective

When the handbook is complete, add a **"What We'd Do Differently Next Time"** section beneath your project plan.

This can include:
- Workflow improvements
- Communication strategies
- Division of work
- Tooling

---

## Team Contributions

Add this table to your final handbook:

| **Team Member** | **Contributions**                                                                                                                             | **Verified By** |

| Bjorn           | - Created the project plan and assigned tasks<br>- Arranged meetings<br>- Wrote most of the section on Task Estimation                        | Benny, Agnetha  |
| Benny           | - Helped write the section on Task Estimation<br>- Standardised formatting across the document<br>- Created all the diagrams for Code Reviews | Bjorn, Agnetha  |
| Agnetha         | - Defined a structure for the document<br>- Did most of the research on Code Reviews and wrote half of that section                           | Bjorn, Benny    |
