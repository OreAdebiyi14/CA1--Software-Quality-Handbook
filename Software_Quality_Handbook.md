# [Task Estimation in Scrum](docs/task_estimation.md) 

---

## **1. Overview & Importance**  
- Task estimation is a critical process in Scrum that allows teams to predict effort, allocate resources effectively, and ensure a balanced workload.
- Without proper estimation, teams may struggle with missed deadlines, overworked developers, and uncontrolled scope creep. Proper task estimation enables better sprint planning, leading to predictable and efficient development cycles.
- For example, as discussed in **[Stories and Task Estimation](https://www.reddit.com/r/scrum/comments/18bbr88/stories_and_task_estimation/)**, teams that implemented structured estimation techniques saw a reduction in last-minute changes and improved sprint predictability.  

---

## **2. Key Guidelines for Effective Estimation**

**Define Clear Estimation Criteria** 
- Teams should establish a shared understanding of effort levels for different tasks. Using consistent criteria helps standardize estimation across different team members.

**Encourage Team Collaboration**  
- Estimation should be a collaborative effort involving all team members. Diverse perspectives lead to more accurate estimations, reducing the risk of underestimation or overestimation.

**Review & Improve Estimates Continuously** 
- Compare previous estimates with actual completion times to improve future accuracy.

**Select the Right Estimation Method** 
- Choose estimation techniques that fit the complexity of the task.

---

## **3. Different Types of Estimation**
Estimation techniques vary in complexity and accuracy, and choosing the right approach is essential. According to **[How to Estimate Tasks in Scrum?](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/216796/how-to-estimate-tasks-in-scrum)**, teams often struggle to balance precision with efficiency, which is why a combination of methods is often recommended.


**Consensus-Based Estimation:**
  - **Planning Poker** – A collaborative estimation technique where team members assign story points based on discussion and consensus.
  
**Relative Sizing:**
  - **T-Shirt Sizing** – Categorises tasks into sizes like XS, S, M, L, XL for quick estimation.
  - **Affinity Estimation** – Groups tasks based on similarities in effort, allowing teams to estimate large backlogs efficiently.
  
**Work Breakdown Approach:**
  - **Breaking Down Large Tasks** – Dividing large user stories into smaller tasks improves accuracy and reduces ambiguity in estimation.  

The following diagram provides a **visual breakdown** of estimation techniques:

 ```mermaid

## **4. Strategies to Improve Estimation Accuracy**
- **Include Risk Factors** – Consider complexity, dependencies, and uncertainties in estimations.
- **Timebox Estimation Discussions** – Avoid overanalysing estimates to keep the process efficient.
- **Run Post-Sprint Reviews** – Discuss estimation accuracy after sprints to refine future estimates.

---

## **5. Common Mistakes & Bad Practices**  
Many teams fall into common estimation pitfalls, such as over-estimating to buffer time or underestimating complexity. **[Let's Talk About Estimates](https://medium.com/@patrickbrock_40978/lets-talk-about-estimates-f4ca45db96fb)** describes how unrealistic estimates can lead to misaligned expectations and project delays.


**Over-Estimating to Be Safe** – Excessive padding can lead to inefficiencies, resulting in wasted time and resources. 

**Underestimating Task Complexity** – Failing to account for hidden complexities can lead to unfinished sprints, technical debt, and missed deadlines.

**Lack of Iterative Improvement** – Not refining estimation techniques results in persistent inaccuracies.  

To further illustrate these points, consider the following video:

# [Debugging & Bug Tracking](docs/debugging.md)

## 1. Overview & Importance

**Overview**
- Debugging and bug tracking are core parts of maintaining high software quality in fast-paced development environments. Debugging involves identifying, isolating, and resolving defects in code, while bug tracking provides a structured way to report, prioritize, and monitor those defects over time.

**Importance**
- Without proper debugging and tracking, defects often slip into production, causing user frustration, reduced trust, and delays in development. Implementing solid practices in these areas leads to faster issue resolution, clearer team communication, and more stable releases.

---

## 2. Best Practices for Debugging

**Systematic and effective debugging can dramatically reduce resolution time. Here are key practices:**

- **Always Reproduce the Bug First:** If you can’t reproduce it, you can’t fix it. Ensure the issue is consistently occurring.
- **Use Logging and Stack Traces:** Logs and stack traces offer vital insight into runtime issues. Ensure logs are clean, useful, and easy to search.
- **Leverage Debugging Tools:** Use built-in IDE tools or browser debuggers (e.g., Chrome DevTools, VS Code debugger) to step through code.
- **Change One Variable at a Time:** Avoid making multiple fixes at once—it makes it harder to identify the root cause.
- **Pair Programming / Rubber Ducking:** Explaining the issue to a teammate (or even an inanimate object) often helps reveal overlooked clues.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Bug Discovered] --> B[Reproduce Bug];
    B --> C[Analyze Logs/Stack Trace];
    C --> D[Use Debugger/Print Statements];
    D --> E[Isolate the Root Cause];
    E --> F[Apply Fix];
    F --> G[Test Fix Thoroughly];
    G --> H[Submit Fix for Review];
```


---

## 3. Best Practices for Bug Tracking

**Effective bug tracking ensures transparency, accountability, and prioritization.**

- **Write Clear and Concise Reports:** Include the issue summary, reproduction steps, expected vs. actual results, environment info, and screenshots/logs.
- **Tag Severity and Priority:** Categorize bugs by how critical they are (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- **Triage Regularly:** Host bug triage meetings to reassess priorities, close outdated issues, and assign new bugs.
- **Link to Related Work:** Connect bug tickets to relevant commits, pull requests, or documentation.
- **One Issue per Report:** Avoid combining multiple bugs in one ticket—it complicates tracking and fixing.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Bug Report Submitted] --> B[Review by Team];
    B --> C{Valid Bug?};
    C -- Yes --> D[Assign Priority & Severity];
    D --> E[Assign to Developer];
    E --> F[Fix Implemented];
    F --> G[Test & Close Bug];
    C -- No --> H[Close as Invalid/Duplicate];
```

---

## 4. Debugging & Bug Tracking Tools

**Popular tools to enhance your debugging and tracking process:**

### Debugging Tools:
- **Chrome DevTools** – Frontend debugging in the browser.
- **VS Code Debugger** – Step through server/client code.
- **Xcode/Android Studio** – Mobile debugging with breakpoints and logs.

### Bug Tracking Tools:
- **JIRA** – Robust tracking with sprint integration.
- **GitHub Issues** – Lightweight and integrated with repositories.
- **Linear** – Modern, fast bug/issue tracker with clean UX.

**Tips:**
- Use bug report templates to maintain consistency.
- Integrate tools with Slack or email for updates.

---

## 5. Common Mistakes & Bad Practices

Avoid these frequent pitfalls when debugging or tracking bugs:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Mistakes to Avoid"
        A1[Unclear Bug Reports]
        A2[Skipping Reproduction Step]
        A3[No Logs or Screenshots]
        A4[Fix Without Testing]
    end
```

- **Unclear Bug Reports:** Lack of context wastes time.
- **Not Reproducing the Bug:** Leads to guesswork and improper fixes.
- **No Supporting Evidence:** Logs or screenshots can often speed up resolution.
- **Fixing Without Testing:** Risk of regressions or incomplete fixes.
- **Ignoring Bug Backlogs:** Technical debt increases when bugs are left unresolved.
