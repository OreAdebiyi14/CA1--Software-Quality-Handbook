## Introduction

Software quality is essential for enduring reliable, maintainable, and efficient software development. We created this Handbook to prevent any future inconsistent workflows that could lead to unpredictable progress or frequent defects in production. 

To address these challenges, this Software Quality Handbook will establish the best practices to improve any development, consistency and efficiency.

This handbook will serve as a guidline for developers to cover key aspects of software quality assurance including:

- Task estimation, 
- Code reviews, 
- Debugging techniques
