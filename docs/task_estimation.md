# Task Estimation in Scrum 

---

## **1. Overview & Importance**  
- Accurate task estimation is crucial for effective sprint planning, ensuring realistic deadlines and balanced workloads.  
- Poor estimation can lead to missed deadlines, overworked teams, and scope creep.  

---

## **2. Key Guidelines for Effective Estimation**
- **Define Clear Estimation Criteria** – Establish shared understanding of effort levels among team members.
- **Encourage Team Collaboration** – Ensure all members of the team participate in the estimation process.

---

## **3. Different Types of Estimation**
- **Consensus-Based Estimation:**
  - **Planning Poker** – Uses story points to align teams through discussion.
- **Relative Sizing:**
  - **T-Shirt Sizing** – Categorises tasks into sizes like XS, S, M, L, XL.
  - **Affinity Estimation** – Groups similar tasks and estimates their effort collectively.
- **Work Breakdown Approach:**
  - **Breaking Down Large Tasks** – Ensures better estimation accuracy by dividing tasks into smaller components.  

---

## **4. Strategies to Improve Estimation Accuracy**
- **Include Risk Factors** – Consider complexity, dependencies, and uncertainties in estimations.
- **Timebox Estimation Discussions** – Avoid overanalysing estimates to keep the process efficient.
- **Run Post-Sprint Reviews** – Discuss estimation accuracy after sprints to refine future estimates.

---

## **5. Common Mistakes & Bad Practices**  
- **Over-Estimating to Be Safe** – Adding excessive padding wastes time and misallocates resources.  
- **Underestimating Task Complexity** – Leads to sprint overflows and technical debt.  

---

## **6. Tools & Techniques for Estimation**  
- **JIRA & Confluence** – Track past sprint estimations and improve future ones.  
- **GitHub Issues & Story Points** – Assign and review estimations for accuracy.  

---

## **7. Quick Reference Summary**  
- Involve **the whole team** in estimation discussions.  
- Avoid **common pitfalls like underestimating complexity and ignoring risk factors**.  

---

## **8. Conclusion & Next Steps**  
- Task estimation is an iterative process that improves over time.  
- Teams should regularly **review and adjust their estimation methods** to match real project timelines.
